   * Mvvm : 
   Model-View-ViewModel is an architecural approach used to abstract the state and behaviour of a view, which allows us to separate the development of the UI from the business logic. This is accomplished by the introduction of a ViewModel, whos responsibility is to expose the data objects of a model and handle any of the applications logic involved in the display of a view.
   Model View ViewModel
   View : That informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions . Defines the structure, layout and appearance of a view on screen
   ViewModel : exposes streams of data relevant to the View.Acts a link between the View and Model, dealing with any view logic
   Model :  abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.Data model containing business and validation logic
