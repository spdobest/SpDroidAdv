   <dl> 
   
   <dt>MVVM</dt>  
   <dt>Model-View-ViewModel </dt> 
   <dd>is an architecural approach used to abstract the state and behaviour of a view, which allows us to separate the development of the UI from the business logic. This is accomplished by the introduction of a ViewModel, whos responsibility is to expose the data objects of a model and handle any of the applications logic involved in the display of a view.
   </dd>
   <dt>View : </dt> 
   <dd>That informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions . Defines the structure, layout and appearance of a view on screen</dd>
   <dt>ViewModel : </dt>
   <dd>exposes streams of data relevant to the View.Acts a link between the View and Model, dealing with any view logic</dd>
   <dt>Model : </dt>
   <dd>abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.Data model containing business and validation logic</dd>
   <dl>
   <dt>MVP</dt>  
   <dt>Onserver</dt>
